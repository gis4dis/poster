# Poster

Application for geo-spatial data collection and processing. 

## General requirements

* Python 3.2+

**For local development:**
* docker (https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)
* docker-compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

both installed on localhost.

Copy exapmle.env as .env - it should have reasonable defaults.

## How to run local dev environment

**Basic `docker-compose` commands:**

### `docker-compose up`

Run the whole cluster on localhost:
 { Django + Celery + Redis + Postgis + (Mongo) }
   
The first run will also runs `docker-compose build`,
 which builds the "web" docker container.

### `docker-compose build`
(Re)builds the "web" docker container.

This will (re)build the web docker image with new 
 *requirement.txt* file
 
For more information see *Dockerfile*.

### `docker-compose rm -v`
This command removes created temporary volumes that were
 attached to docker containers.
 
When the docker containers are not properly shut, 
 the attached volume(s) can in some cases stay
 detached but created and running `docker-compose up` will
 end with error, complaining about "same volume names".

**Advanced commands**

### `docker-compose up | tee docker.log`

Taken from `man tee` page:

|*tee - read from standard input and write to standard output and files*

This command will send output (logs) of all docker containers to:
* terminal
* file `docker.log`

You can use this log file to further examine and filter logs with your
 favorite tool. (grep, less, ...)
 The logfile will get erased on every new run (feature).
 
### `less -R docker.log` + `&search-term‚èé`

This will open *docker.log* file in less (-R flag preserves 
 the terminal colors). Then you can you in-build filter function
 to obtain only the logs you are interested in.

### `sudo docker-compose logs --tail 20 poster_celery_worker`
This will display last 20 log messages from `poster_celery_worker` service.
 You can find the service names in *docker-compose.yml* file as well as in
 the log prepended on each line. 
 
If you omit the `--tail #` flag it will display **all logs** 
 from **all previous runs**. Use it with caution.

### Import DB dump
```
psql postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres < /path/to/dump
```
